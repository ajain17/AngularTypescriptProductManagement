You need to have node module http-server installed in order to run this app.

For installing TypeScript definition files, I have used tsd npm module. 

To run the application, open terminal and go to the directory containing index.html. Run the following command:

```
$ http-server
```

This will show you a message saying Available on :   http://127.0.0.1:8080. 

Once you get this message, the app is up and running.
